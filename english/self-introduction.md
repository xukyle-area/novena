# 自我介绍

## **English Version**

Hello, my name is Xu Zhongjian. I graduated from Heilongjiang University in 2020 with a degree in Electronic Engineering. After graduation, I worked at Xiaomi and Meituan. Currently, I work at Tiger Brokers as a software engineer.

My first job after graduation was at Xiaomi, where I was responsible for developing retail store backend systems, including inventory and sales. Then at Meituan's hotel, I developed internal CRM systems, primarily managing the lifecycle of franchise partners.

Over the past few years at Tiger Brokers’ crypto exchange, I focused on two major areas:

- First, the market data system, which involves not only internal data processing, such as candle and tick data generation, but also high-availability external data integration.
- And second, OTC trading, where I led the architecture design and development, from connecting with external liquidity providers to handling internal order and settlement workflows.

Through years of professional experience, I have developed extensive expertise, and I'm proficient in the Java eco-system, with deep practical experience in high-concurrency systems, real-time data processing, and distributed system architecture design. Thank you!

你好，我叫徐中建，2020 年毕业于黑龙江大学电子信息工程专业。毕业后任职于小米和美团。目前，我在老虎证券担任软件工程师。

我毕业后的第一份工作是在小米，负责开发零售门店后端系统，包括但不限于库存和销售模块。之后，我在美团酒店事业部开发了内部CRM系统，主要负责管理加盟合作伙伴的生命周期。

在老虎证券加密货币交易所的过去几年里，我主要专注于两个领域：

（1）市场数据系统，涵盖内部数据处理（例如蜡烛和报价数据生成）和高可用性外部数据集成；

（2）场外交易，我领导了架构设计和开发，从连接外部流动性提供商到处理内部订单和结算工作流程。

多年的专业经验，让我积累了丰富的专业知识，精通Java生态系统，在高并发系统、实时数据处理、分布式系统架构设计等方面拥有丰富的实践经验。谢谢！
