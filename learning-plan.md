## Daily Practice Method (40 minutes)

### Phase 1: Vocabulary Review (5 minutes)
- Quickly scan all words in today's file
- Mark any unfamiliar terms

### Phase 2: Sentence Construction (30 minutes)
**Key Practice**: For each major concept, create 2-3 complete sentences:
1. **Definition sentence**: "X is a..."
2. **Usage sentence**: "In my project, I used X to..."
3. **Benefit sentence**: "This helped us achieve/improve..."

Example:
- ❌ Just knowing: "load balancer"
- ✅ Can say: "A load balancer is a component that distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers. In my previous project, I implemented Nginx as a load balancer to handle 10,000 concurrent requests. This helped us achieve 99.9% uptime and reduced response time by 40%."

### Phase 3: Speaking Practice (5 minutes)
- Pick 3-5 key terms from today's file
- Explain them out loud as if you're in an interview
- Record yourself if possible
- Focus on fluency over perfection

## Backend Knowledge Practice (20-30 minutes)

**Do this AFTER vocabulary practice, or in a separate session**

### Daily Routine:
1. **Choose 2-3 knowledge points** (5 min)
   - From `backend-knowledge-practice.md`
   - Related to today's vocabulary topic

2. **Explain in English** (15 min)
   - What it is (definition)
   - Why we use it (benefits)
   - When to use it (scenarios)
   - How it works (principles)
   - Example from your project

3. **Record or write** (5-10 min)
   - Record audio OR write in `daily-practice-log.md`
   - Focus on clear, complete sentences

### Example:
**Topic: HashMap**
- "HashMap is a data structure that stores key-value pairs using hashing..."
- "We use HashMap when we need O(1) lookup time..."
- "In my e-commerce project, I used HashMap to cache product information..."
- "However, HashMap is not thread-safe, so in concurrent environments, we should use ConcurrentHashMap instead..."

**See `backend-knowledge-practice.md` for detailed knowledge points**
